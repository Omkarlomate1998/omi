        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <li class="highlight">Combine the chicken in a bowl with the yogurt, curry powder, and cinnamon and let marinate for at least 1 hour but preferably at least 4 hours</li>
        <li class="highlight"> To parboil the rice: Thoroughly rinse the rice until the water draining from it is clear and no longer milky. Soak the rice in a bowl of water for 15-30 minutes. </li>
        <li> Fill a pot with salted water. Drain the rice and add it the pot. Bring it to a boil and cook for 4-6 minutes until the tips of the rice are clear.<br> Pour the rice into a strainer and rinse with lukewarm water. Let the rice thoroughly drain while you continue with the next steps.</li>
        <li>Heat the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook the onions until golden, 7-8 minutes.<br> Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the chicken and all of the marinade along with the salt. </li>
        <li>Stir to combine, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the chicken is cooked through, 6-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rice, cilantro and raisins. Pour the chicken broth over the mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover and simmer for 3-4 minutes until the rice is soft and the mixture is heated through. Add salt to taste. Serve immediately.</li>
